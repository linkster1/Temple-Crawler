# Temple-Crawler
Want random temples to spawn in your Minecraft world? Well, just install this into your Minecraft server, and go to new chunks to have a chance of finding a building in the biome! NOTES: Different buildings in each biome. Different qualities (Common, Rare, Ultra Rare) of buildings. Traps ARE inside of buildings. Rewards become bigger, as traps do, as the building gets rarer.
